''' modules are files that contain Python code
    code can be executed directly or imported
    module == usually referred to as code that's intended
        to be imported although the generic description of module
        is just a file that contains python code
    
    when we import a module, the module becomes available to us
    using the module name.
'''

''' heres a module called mymodule.py
'''

# mymodule.py 

''' this is not designed to be executed, it's designed to be imported
'''

thing = 10

def someThing():
    print("someThing function executed!")
